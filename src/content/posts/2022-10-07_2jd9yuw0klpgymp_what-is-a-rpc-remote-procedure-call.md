A **remote procedure call** (RPC) is a mechanism of communication between two computational environments, where one can be identified as a client, while the other can be identified as a server.

From the client's point of view, the RPC is just a matter of calling a function with the desired arguments and await for the response, in order to continue the program's execution.

Thus, using an RPC allows one programmer to distribute the system, according to their needs.
